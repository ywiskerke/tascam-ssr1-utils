# tascam-ssr1-utils

This is a monitoring tool for the serial protocol that the Tascam SS-R1 uses. Newer models (ie. CDR250) are using the same protocol, but over TCP (see documentation)
This code was written as a first exercise to understand the interaction with the SS-R1.

### Serial Connection

Be sure to use the right serial cable if you are attempting the communication.
